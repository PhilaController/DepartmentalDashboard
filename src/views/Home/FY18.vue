      Welcome to the FY18 Departmental Audit Dashboard
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing the affairs
      of every officer, department, board, and commission of the city, annually.
      As part of these duties, the Controller's Office performs the Departmental
      Audit, which reviews the financial affairs of all City departments. The
      audit tests whether City departments have sufficient internal controls to
      ensure accurate financial information and compliance with any laws and
      regulations related to revenue and expenditure activities. The audit
      examines internal controls in several areas, including petty cash,
      personal property, revenue and receipts, and personal services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Controller’s Office used a new risk-based approach for testing
      revenues and expenditures during the Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) Departmental
      Audit. Each city department received a tier rating that takes in to
      account significant revenue and expenditures within each department, the
      internal controls in place over revenues and expenditures, and the
      significance of the previous year’s audit findings related to internal
      controls and their potential impact on the City’s financial statements.
      The tier ratings range from 1 to 3, with tier 1 indicating that the
      department has the largest potential impact on the City's financial
      statements and tier 3 the least.
    </p>

    <h4>Tier 1</h4>
    <p>
      Departments with revenue and expenditure amounts or processes that may
      significantly impact the city’s financial statements. For example, a
      department with significant revenue and expenditures, such as the
      Department of Public Health, would be designated as a Tier 1;
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-3">Tier 2</h4>
    <p>
      Departments that have certain revenue or expenditure amounts or internal
      controls that may significantly impact the city’s financial statements.
      For example, a department with significant findings from prior years, such
      as the Office of Finance, would be designated as a Tier 2; and
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-3">Tier 3</h4>
    <p>
      Departments that do not appear to have revenue or expenditure amounts that
      significantly impact the city’s financial statements. For example, the
      Board of Ethics would be designated as a Tier 3.

    <h2>User Guide</h2>

    <p>
      This dashboard summarizes key audit findings for departments that
      represent the largest potential risk to the City's financial statements,
      designated as Tier 1 and Tier 2. The findings for each tier of departments
      can be selected using the navigation links at the top of this page.
      Findings for an individual department can be viewed by clicking on the
      department's name.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard focuses on key findings from the Departmental Audit for
      Fiscal Year 2018. Rather than present all findings for every department,
      the dashboard focuses on findings in several key areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enforcement of the City's sick leave policy;</li>
      <li>Use of a sick leave policy for exempt employees;</li>
      <li>Authorization of employee overtime;</li>
      <li>Supervisory review of daily attendance records; and</li>
      <li>Monitoring and checking payroll accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, the dashboard highlights one additional significant finding
      for the Department of Licenses and Inspections. L&I failed to reconcile
      revenue from housing inspection license renewals, which totaled $15
      million for FY18, to the City's accounting system daily.
