      The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing the affairs
      of every officer, department, board, and commission of the city, annually.
      As part of these duties, the Controller's Office performs the Departmental
      Audit, which reviews the financial affairs of all City departments. The
      audit tests whether City departments have sufficient internal controls to
      ensure accurate financial information and compliance with any laws and
      regulations related to revenue and expenditure activities. The audit
      examines internal controls in several areas, including petty cash,
      personal property, revenue and receipts, and personal services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning in FY18, the Controller’s Office used a new risk-based approach
      for testing revenues and expenditures during the Departmental Audit. Each
      city department receives a tier rating that takes in to account
      significant revenue and expenditures within each department, the internal
      controls in place over revenues and expenditures, and the significance of
      the previous year’s audit findings related to internal controls and their
      potential impact on the City’s financial statements. The tier ratings
      range from 1 to 3, with tier 1 indicating that the department has the
      largest potential impact on the City's financial statements and tier 3 the
      least.
    </p>

    <h4>Tier 1</h4>
    <p>
      Departments with revenue and expenditure amounts or processes that may
      significantly impact the city’s financial statements. For example, a
      department with significant revenue and expenditures, such as the
      Department of Public Health, would be designated as a Tier 1;
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-3">Tier 2</h4>
    <p>
      Departments that have certain revenue or expenditure amounts or internal
      controls that may significantly impact the city’s financial statements.
      For example, a department with significant findings from prior years, such
      as the Finance Department, would be designated as a Tier 2; and
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-3">Tier 3</h4>
    <p>
      Departments that do not appear to have revenue or expenditure amounts that
      significantly impact the city’s financial statements. For example, the
      Board of Ethics would be designated as a Tier 3.

      This dashboard summarizes key audit findings for departments that
      represent the largest potential risk to the City's financial statements,
      designated as Tier 1 and Tier 2. The findings for each tier of departments
      can be selected using the navigation links at the top of this page.
      Findings for an individual department can be viewed by clicking on the
      department's name.

      This dashboard focuses on <b>key findings</b> from the FY19 Departmental
      Audit. Rather than present all findings for every department, the
      dashboard focuses on findings in several key areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enforcement of the City's sick leave policy;</li>
      <li>Use of a sick leave policy for exempt employees;</li>
      <li>Authorization of employee overtime;</li>
      <li>Supervisory review of daily attendance records; and</li>
      <li>Monitoring and checking payroll accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, the dashboard highlights one additional significant finding
      for the Department of Licenses and Inspections (L&I). For the second year
      in a row, L&I failed to reconcile revenue from housing inspection license
      renewals, which totaled $16.4 million for FY19, to the City's accounting
      system daily.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Note</h2>
    <hr class="titlebar" />
    <p>
      A department's risk rating can change from year to year. This assigned
      rating impacts the amount of testing and level of scrutiny for each
      department during the audit process. For this reason, the findings
      presented here for FY19 are not directly comparable to audit findings from
      previous years.
